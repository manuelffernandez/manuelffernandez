# ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone, I'm Manuel

I'm a 26-yo self-taught developer from Argentina. I have a passion for web development, specifically in the frontend using **React** as my primary library.

#### :brain: Some facts:
- I studied Mathematics at university for three years
- I took a front-end developer course at Coderhouse
- I'm currently studying PostgreSQL at EDTeam platform

I have experience with languages like **HTML**, **CSS&SCSS**, **JavaScript**, and **TypeScript**. Throughout my development journey, I have honed my skills in using these languages to create more scalable applications with clean code.

In my projects, I frequently utilize popular libraries such as **React Router**, **Redux Toolkit**, **MUI**, **Bootstrap**, and **Formik**.

ðŸ‘€ I invite you to check out some of my projects and see for yourself! Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions/suggestions or would like to collaborate.
