# 👋 Hello everyone, I'm Manuel

I'm a 26-yo self-taught developer from Argentina. I have a passion for web development, specifically in the frontend using **React** as my primary library.

#### 🧠 Some facts:
- I'm currently participating in a web development simulation organized by [NoCountry](https://www.nocountry.tech/)
- Continusly learning on several online programming academies
- I studied Bachelor's on Mathematics at university for three years

✍️ I have experience with languages like **HTML**, **CSS&SCSS**, **JavaScript**, and **TypeScript**. Throughout my development journey, I have honed my skills in using these languages to create more scalable applications with clean code.

📕 In my projects, I frequently utilize popular libraries such as **React Router**, **Redux Toolkit**, **MUI**, **Bootstrap**, and **Formik**.
I have recently cultivated a keen interest in the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework.

👀 I invite you to check out some of my projects and see for yourself! Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions/suggestions or would like to collaborate.
